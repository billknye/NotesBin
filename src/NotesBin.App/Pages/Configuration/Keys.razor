<h3>Keys</h3>

<h4>Asymmetric Keys</h4>

<p>
    Asymmetric keys are Public/Private key pairs used to encrypt symmetric keys.  Each asymmetric key must have at least one credential
    which can be used to decrypt the private key.  An asymmetric key can have multiple credentials, for example a password and a recovery
    code.

<h4>Symmetric Keys</h4>
<p>
    Symmetric keys are used to encrypt and decrypt data.  A default symmetric key is used to encrypt and decrypt the metadata such as the 
    index and configuration details.  Multiple symmetric keys can be used to provide various levels of access or even allow mulitple users 
    to share notes.  Individual notes can be only be encrypted by a single key but symmetric keys can be accessible by more than one
    asymmetric key
